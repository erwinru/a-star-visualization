# A-star Algorithm
This is visualization of the A-star pathfinding algorithm. You can try it out [here](https://erwinru.github.io/path-finding/).

1. Select a-star as an algorithm and octile as an heristic.
2. You can draw walls with your curser
3. You can adjust the start and end position by dragging the points.
4. Click on start and you will see how the algorithm is trying to find the shortest way between the points.
